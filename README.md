# BabyCarSeat-Sales-Predictions
* This was a group project done with Jin Chen, Beom Ki Lee, and Sushant Varghese
* __Objective:__ Determine which regression model (stepwise selection, best subset selection, and decision trees) would best predict baby car seat sales based on store location characteristics. 
* __Results:__ A 5-predictor multilinear regression model using either stepwise or best subset selection was more reliable than the decision tree model, with a 12% reduced RMSE and 2% improved correlation. 
* Suggested a new linear regression model that would predict baby car seat sales based on the location characteristics of price, education, age, advertising, and shelving location.
